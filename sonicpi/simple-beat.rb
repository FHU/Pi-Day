# This program creates a simple, but random, beat
loop do
  # First it plays a bass drum along with four hi hat sounds (:drum_cymbal)
  sample :drum_heavy_kick
  4.times do
    # The if/else conditionals will randomly pick either the first sample or the second if the condition is not met
    # The one_in(4) means that the first sample will only occur if the computer rolls a four-sided dice and gets a one
    if one_in(4)

  # The second half of this code plays a snare and plays one of the two cymbal sounds again
